CForest is a Python package that implements the Causal Forest algorithm
proposed by Athey and Wager (2018)[1], which builds on the closely related
Causal Tree algorithm introduced by Athey and Imbens (2016)[2]. The algorithm
can be used to estimate heterogenous treatment effects in a standard potential
outcome framework.
