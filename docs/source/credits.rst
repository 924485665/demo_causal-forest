CForest is designed and maintained by Tim Mensinger (`timmens
<https://github.com/timmens>`_).

However, the algorithms that are implemented here stem from the pioneering work
of Athey and Wager (2018) [1] and Athey and Imbens (2016) [2].
Furthermore, we want to refer to the generalized random forest package (`grf
<https://github.com/grf-labs/grf>`_), which implements the Causal Forest
algorithm and much more --see Athey, Tibshirani and Wager (2019) [3].
